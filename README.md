# My Awesome Project
This is a web app designed to help Magic: The Gathering Players look up cards to build decks with. It links to a public MTG API and displays card info such as toughness, skills, and flavor text

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This web application is front end focused and gathers data by consuming the public MTG API. It allows users to search for cards and displays the cards information, as well as a thumbnail. The cards information includes: Manacost, Toughness/Power, Attributes, and FlavorText. If information is not available, the information's space is filled with undefined. I made this to practice consuming 3rd party APIs and manipulating the data retrieved from them. 

## Optimizations
In the future I would like to add a back end to make this a full stack web application, and allow users to build and save prospective Magic The Gathering decks. I would also like to add a glossary page that allows users to see which cards are stored in the MTG API's database, and allow users to export their decks as lists for printing out/ shopping for cards. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned alot about consuming public API's and manipulating the data that they supply to my applications. I also learned how to plug that info into my front end views with user inputs (such gathering data from a text field and applying event listeners to buttons).
